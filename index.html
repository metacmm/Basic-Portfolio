                    My name is Xiaojie Liu. I was born in China, and went to college in Shanghai to get my bachelor and mater degree there. 
                    I moved to Seattle several years ago, I like this city, it is beautiful especiall in summer season.<br>
                    Moving to a different country far from home is a big challenge to me, but it is also a great opportunity for me to get to know
                    people from different place, understand different culture, that is exciting.<br>
                    Coding is part of my life, not just because it is my major and my work, I also like the feeling to make things happen while you just typing on a computer.
                    And I also like hiking, watching movies and cooking.
